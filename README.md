DrizzlePac is a software package that replaces the Dither package in STSDAS. It is a suite of supporting tasks for astrodrizzle which include:

- tweakreg and tweakback for aligning images in different visits
- pixtopix transforms an X,Y pixel position to its pixel position after distortion corrections
- skytopix transforms sky coordinates to X,Y pixel positions. A reverse transformation can be done using the task pixtosky
