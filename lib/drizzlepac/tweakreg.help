Tweakreg provides an automated interface for computing residual shifts
between input exposures being combined using `AstroDrizzle`. The offsets
computed by Tweakreg correspond to pointing differences after applying the WCS
information from the input image's headers.  Such errors would, for example,
be due to errors in guide-star positions when combining observations from
different observing visits or from slight offsets introduced upon re-acquiring
the guide stars in a slightly different position.

Parameters
----------
file : str or list of str  (Default = ``'*flt.fits'``)
    Input files (passed in from *files* parameter)
    This paramater can be provided in any of several forms:

     - filename of a single image
     - filename of an association (ASN)table
     - wild-card specification for files in directory (using ``\*``, ``?`` etc.)
     - comma-separated list of filenames
     - ``@file`` filelist containing list of desired input filenames
       (and optional inverse variance map filenames)

    The ``@file`` filelist needs to be provided as an ASCII text file
    containing a list of filenames for all input images with one
    filename on each line of the file. If inverse variance maps have
    also been created by the user and are to be used (by specifying
    ``IVM`` to the parameter `final_wht_type` described further below),
    then these are simply provided as a second column in the filelist,
    with each ``IVM`` filename listed on the same line as a second entry,
    after its corresponding exposure filename.

editpars : bool (Default = False)
    A parameter that allows user to edit input parameters by hand in the GUI.
    True to use the GUI to edit parameters.

configObj : configObject (Default = None)
    An instance of `configObject` which overrides default parameter settings.

imagefindcfg : dict, configObject (Default = None)
    An instance of `dict` or `configObject` which overrides default source
    finding (for input images) parameter settings. See help for
    `imagefindpars` PSET for a list of available parameters. **Only** the
    parameters that are different from default values  **need** to be specified
    here.

refimagefindcfg : dict, configObject (Default = None)
    An instance of `dict` or `configObject` which overrides default source
    finding (for input reference image) parameter settings. See help for
    `refimagefindpars` PSET for a list of available parameters. **Only** the
    parameters that are different from default values **need** to be specified
    here.

inputDict : dict, optional
    An optional list of parameters specified by the user, which can also
    be used to override the defaults.

    .. note:: This list of parameters **can** contain parameters specific
       to the `TweakReg` task itself described here in the "Other Parameters"
       section and **may not** contain parameters from the `imagefindpars`
       and `refimagefindpars` PSETs.


Other Parameters
----------------

refimage : str (Default = '')
    Filename of reference image. Sources derived from this image will be
    used as the reference for matching with sources from all input images.

exclusions: string (Default = '')
    This parameter allows the user to specify a set of files which contain
    regions in the image to ignore when finding sources.  This file MUST
    have 1 line for each input image with the name of the input file in the
    first column.  Subsequent columns would be used to specify an exclusion
    file for each chip in ``'SCI,<n>'`` index order. If a chip does not require
    an exclusion file, the string `None` or ``INDEF`` can be used as a
    placeholder for that chip. The last *optional* column (after the last
    column with chip exclusion file name) can contain the string
    '[ConformDS9]' (without apostrophes). When present, this will indicate that
    region files can contain both regular and "exclude" regions and that they
    should be interpreted as such. If '[ConformDS9]' is not present then the
    normal regions will be interpreted as "exclude" regions and the
    DS9 exclude regions will be omitted.

    Each chip's exclusion file should conform to the 'region' file format
    generated by DS9. The region files can contain both regular regions
    as well as "exclude" regions. The "ruler", "compass", and "projection"
    regions are not supported (ignored). Currently these regions **must**
    be provided in *image* coordinates. The task `MapReg` can be used for
    (semi-)automated generation of region files in 'image' coordinates from a
    "master" region file provided in sky coordinates.
    *See notes below for more information.*

updatewcs : bool (Default = No)
    Update WCS keywords of input images?

writecat : bool (Default = Yes)
    Specify whether or not to write out the source catalogs generated for
    each input image by the built-in source extraction algorithm.

clean : bool (Default = No)
    Specify whether or not to remove the temporary files created by
    `tweakreg`, including any catalog files generated for the shift
    determination.

interactive : bool (Default = Yes)
    This switch controls whether the program stops and waits for the user to
    examine any generated plots before continuing on to the next image.  If
    turned off, plots will still be displayed, but they will also be saved to
    disk automatically as a PNG image with an autogenerated name without
    requiring any user input.

verbose : bool (Default = No)
    Specify whether or not to print extra messages during
    processing.

runfile : string (Default = 'tweakreg.log')
    Specify the filename of the processing log.

*UPDATE HEADER*
updatehdr : bool (Default = No)
    Specify whether or not to update the headers of each input image
    directly with the shifts that were determined. This will allow the
    input images to be combined by `AstroDrizzle` without having to provide
    the shiftfile as well.

wcsname : str (Default = 'TWEAK')
    Name of updated WCS.

*HEADERLET CREATION*
headerlet: bool (Default = No)
    Specify whether or not to generate a headerlet from the images at
    the end of the task? If turned on, this will create a headerlet
    from the images regardless of the value of the `updatehdr`
    parameter.

attach: bool (Default = Yes)
    If creating a headerlet, choose whether or not to attach the new
    headerlet to the input image as a new extension.


hdrfile: string (Default = '')
    Filename to use for writing out headerlet to a separate file. If the name
    does not contain ``.fits``, it will create a filename from the
    rootname of the input image, the value of this string, and it will end
    in ``'_hlet.fits'``. For example, if only ``'hdrlet1'`` is given, the
    full filename created will be ``'j99da1f2q_hdrlet1_hlet.fits'`` when
    creating a headerlet for image ``'j99da1f2q_flt.fits'``.

clobber: bool (Default = No)
    If a headerlet with 'hdrfile' already exists on disk, specify
    whether or not to overwrite that previous file.

hdrname: string (Default = '')
    Unique name to give to headerlet solution. This name will be used to
    identify this specific WCS alignment solution contained in the headerlet.

author: string, optional (Default = '')
    Name of the creator of the headerlet.

descrip: string, optional (Default = '')
    Short (1-line) description to be included in headerlet as ``DESCRIP`` keyword.
    This can be used to provide a quick look description of the WCS alignment
    contained in the headerlet.

catalog: string, optional (Default = '')
    Name of reference catalog used as the basis for the image alignment.

history: string, optional (Default = '')
    Filename of a file containing detailed information regarding the history
    of the WCS solution contained in the headerlet. This can include information
    on the catalog used for the alignment, or notes on processing that went
    into finalizing the WCS alignment stored in this headerlet. This information
    will be reformatted as 70-character wide FITS HISTORY keyword section.

*OPTIONAL SHIFTFILE OUTPUT*
shiftfile : bool (Default = No)
    Create output shiftfile?

outshifts : str (Default = 'shifts.txt')
    The name for the output shift file created by `tweakreg`.  This
    shiftfile will be formatted for use as direct input to `AstroDrizzle`.


outwcs : str  (Default = 'shifts_wcs.fits')
    Filename to be given to the OUTPUT reference WCS file created
    by `tweakreg`. This reference WCS defines the WCS from which the
    shifts get measured, and will be used by `AstroDrizzle` to interpret
    those shifts. This reference WCS file will be a FITS file that
    only contains the WCS keywords in a Primary header with no image
    data itself. The values will be derived from the FIRST input image
    specified.

*COORDINATE FILE DESCRIPTION*
catfile : str (Default = '')
    Name of file that contains a list of input images and associated
    catalog files generated by the user. Each line of this file will
    contain the name of an input image in the first column. The remaining
    columns will provide the names of the source catalogs for each chip
    in order of the science extension numbers ((SCI,1), (SCI,2), ...).


    A sample catfile, with one line per image would look like::

     image1_flt.fts  cat1_sci1.coo  cat1_sci2.coo
     image2_flt.fts  cat2_sci1.coo  cat2_sci2.coo

xcol : int (Default = 1)
    Column number of X position from the user-generated catalog files
    specified in the catfile.

ycol : int (Default = 2)
    Column number of Y position from the user-generated catalog files
    specified in the catfile.

fluxcol : int (Default = None)
    Column number for the flux values from the user-generated catalog
    files specified in the catfile. These values will only be used if
    a flux limit has been specified by the user using the `maxflux` or
    `minflux` parameters.

maxflux : float (Default = None)
    Limiting flux value for selecting valid objects in the input image's
    catalog.  If specified, this flux will serve as the upper limit of a
    range for selecting objects to be used in matching with objects
    identified in the reference image. If the value is set to `None`, all
    objects with fluxes brighter than the minimum specified in `minflux`
    will be used. If both values are set to `None`, all objects will be used.


minflux : float (Default = None)
    Limiting flux value for selecting valid objects in the input image's
    catalog. If specified, this flux value will serve as the lower limit
    of a range for selecting objects to be used in matching with objects
    identified in the reference image. If the value is set to `None`, all
    objects fainter than the limit specified by `maxflux` will be used.
    If both values are set to `None`, all objects will be used.


fluxunits : str {'counts', 'cps', 'mag'} (Default = 'counts')
    This allows the task to correctly interpret the flux limits specified
    by `maxflux` and `minflux` when sorting the object list for trimming
    of fainter objects.

xyunits : str {'pixels', 'degrees'} (Default = 'pixels')
    Specifies whether the positions in this catalog are already sky pixel
    positions, or whether they need to be transformed to the sky.

nbright : int (Default = None)

    list. If nbright is set equal to `None`, all objects will be used.

*REFERENCE CATALOG DESCRIPTION*
refcat : str (Default = '')
    Name of the external reference catalog file to be used in place of the
    catalog extracted from one of the input images.

refxcol : int (Default = 1)
    Column number of RA in the external catalog file specified by the
    refcat.

refycol : int (Default = 2)
    Column number of Dec in the external catalog file specified by the
    refcat.

refxyunits : str {'pixels','degrees'} (Default = 'degrees')
    Units of sky positions.

rfluxcol : int (Default = None)
    Column number of flux/magnitude values in the external catalog file
    specified by the refcat.

rmaxflux : float (Default = None)
    Limiting flux value used to select valid objects in the external
    catalog. If specified, the flux value will serve as the upper limit
    of a range for selecting objects to be used in matching with objects
    identified in the reference image. If the value is set to `None`,
    all objects with fluxes brighter than the minimum specified in
    `rminflux` will be used. If both values are set to `None`, all
    objects will be used.

rminflux : float (Default = None)
    Limiting flux value used to select valid objects in the external
    catalog. If specified, the flux will serve as the lower limit
    of a range for selecting objects to be used in matching with objects
    identified in the reference image. If the value is set to `None`,
    all objects fainter than the limit specified by `rmaxflux` will be
    used. If both values are set to `None`, all objects will be used.

rfluxunits : {'counts', 'cps', 'mag'} (Default = 'mag')
    This allows the task to correctly interpret the flux limits specified
    by `rmaxflux` and `rminflux` when sorting the object list for trimming
    of fainter objects.

refnbright : int (Default = None)
    Number of brightest objects to keep after sorting the full object
    list. If refnbright is set to `None`, all objects will be used. Used in
    conjunction with refcat.

    Minimum number of identified objects from each input image to use
    in matching objects from other images.

    See 2d histogram for initial offset?

tolerance : float (Default = 1.0)
    The matching tolerance in pixels after applying an initial solution
    derived from the 'triangles' algorithm.  This parameter gets passed
    directly to `xyxymatch` for use in matching the object lists from each
    image with the reference image's object list.

separation : float (Default = 0.0)
    The  minimum  separation for objects in the input and reference
    coordinate lists. Objects closer together than 'separation' pixels
    are removed from the input and reference coordinate lists prior
    to matching. This parameter gets passed directly to `xyxymatch` for
    use in matching the object lists from each image with the reference
    image's object list.

xoffset : float (Default = 0.0)
    Initial estimate for the offset in X between the images and the
    reference frame. This offset will be used for all input images
    provided. If the parameter value is set to `None`, no offset will
    be assumed in matching sources in `xyxymatch`.

yoffset : float (Default = 0.0)
    Initial estimate for the offset in Y between the images and the
    reference frame. This offset will be used for all input images
    provided.If the parameter value is set to None, no offset will
    be assumed in matching sources in `xyxymatch`.

*CATALOG FITTING PARAMETERS*
fitgeometry : str {'shift', 'rscale'} (Default = 'rscale')

    changes from the matched object lists.

residplot : str {'No plot', 'vector', 'residuals', 'both'}  (Default = 'both')

    the same time.

nclip : int (Default = 3)
    Number of clipping iterations in fit.

sigma : float (Default = 3.0)
    Clipping limit in sigma units.


Notes
-----
Tweakreg supports the use of calibrated, distorted images (such as FLT
images for ACS and WFC3, or ``_c0m.fits`` images for WFPC2) as input images.
All coordinates for sources derived from these images (either by this task
or as provided by the user directly) will be corrected for distortion using
the distortion model information specified in each image's header. This
eliminates the need to run 'astrodrizzle' on the input images prior to
running `tweakreg`.

.. note:: All calibrated input images must have been updated using
          `updatewcs` from the `STWCS` package, or as run by `astrodrizzle`,
          to include the full distortion model in the header.

This task will use catalogs, and catalog-matching, based on the `xyxymatch`
algorithm to determine the offset between the input images. The primary
mode of operation will be to extract a catalog of source positions from
each input image using either a 'DAOFIND-like' algorithm or ``SExtractor`` (if
the user has ``SExtractor`` installed). Alternatively, the user can provide
their catalogs of source positions derived from **each input chip**.

The reference frame will be defined either by:

    * the first input image (and associated catalog),
    * a catalog derived from a reference image specified by the user, or
    * a catalog of undistorted sky positions (RA/Dec) and fluxes
        provided by the user.

For a given observation, the distortion model is applied to all distorted
input positions, and the sources from each chip are then combined into a
single catalog of undistorted positions.

The undistorted positions for each observation then get passed to
`xyxymatch` for matching to objects from the reference catalog.

The source lists from each image will generally include cosmic-rays as
detected sources, which can at times significantly confuse object
identification between images. Observations that include long exposures
often have more cosmic-ray events than source objects. As such, isolating
the cosmic-ray events in those cases would significantly improve the
efficiency of common source identification between images. One such method
for trimming potential false detections from each source list would be
to set a flux limit to exclude detections below that limit. As the fluxes
reported in the default source object lists are provided as magnitude
values, setting the `maxflux` or `minflux` parameter value to a magnitude-
based limit, and then setting the `ascend` parameter to `True`, will allow
for the creations of catalogs trimmed of all sources fainter than the
provided limit. The trimmed source list can then be used in matching
sources between images and in establishing the final fitting for the shifts.

A fit can then be performed on the matched set of positions between the
input and the reference to produce the 'shiftfile'. If the user is
confident that the solution will be correct, the header of each input image
can be updated directly with the fit derived for that image. Otherwise,
the 'shiftfile' can be passed to AstroDrizzle for aligning the images.


**Format of Exclusion Catalog**

The format for the exclusions catalog requires 1 line in the file for
every input image, regardless of whether or not that image has
any defined exclusion regions.  A sample file would look like::

 j99da1emq_flt.fits
 j99da1f2q_flt.fits test_exclusion.reg

This file specifies no exclusion files for the first image, and only
an regions file for SCI,1 of the second image.  Should an exclusion
regions file only be needed for the second chip in the second image,
the file would need to look like::

 j99da1emq_flt.fits
 j99da1f2q_flt.fits None test_sci2_exclusion.reg

The value `None` could also be replaced by ``INDEF`` if desired, but either
string needs to be present to signify no regions file for that chip while
the code continues parsing the line to find a file for the second chip.

With the format described above, the "normal" (see below) DS9 regions
in the regions files will be interpreted as regions/parts of the image that
should **not** be used by the source finding algorithm. So, these regions
in fact act as "exclude" regions. The *real* DS9 exclude regions (i.e., the ones
that have "-" in front of their shape name: -circle(...), -box(...)) are being
ignored. This is useful if one desires to exclude some parts of the image
(e.g., vecinity of a very bright/saturated source, diffraction spikes, etc.)
from being used for source finding. This will improve *both* the efficiency
*and* reliability of the matching algorithm by eliminating unreliable sources
from the produced catalogs that could "confuse" the matching algorithm.

However, for many problems it is easier and better to specify not the regions
that need to be excluded from source finding but rather the regions that *must*
be used for source finding. In order instruct `TweakReg` to interpret "normal"
DS9 regions as "include" regions and the true exclude DS9 regions (with "-")
as "exclude" regions, after the last region file name in the exclusion catalog,
users should add the string '[ConformDS9]' (without apostrophes). The previous
example will then become::

 j99da1emq_flt.fits
 j99da1f2q_flt.fits None test_sci2_inclusion_and_exclusion.reg [ConformDS9]
 j99da1f2r_flt.fits test_sci1_exclusion.reg test_sci2_exclusion.reg


**Format of Region Files**

The format of the exclusions catalogs referenced in the 'exclusions'
file defaults to the format written out by DS9 using the 'DS9/Funtools'
region file format.  A sample file with circle() regions will look like::

 # Region file format: DS9 version 4.1
 # Filename: j99da1f2q_flt.fits[SCI]
 global color=green dashlist=8 3 width=1 font="helvetica 10 normal roman"
 select=1 highlite=1 dash=0 fixed=0 edit=1 move=1 delete=1 include=1 source=1
 image
 circle(3170,198,20)
 ellipse(3269,428,30,10,45) # a rotated ellipse
 box(3241.1146,219.78132,20,20,15) # a rotated box
 circle(200,200,50)  # outer circle
 -circle(200,200,30) # inner circle

This region file can function both as an exclusion or as an inclusion region
file depending on the presence of the [ConformDS9] string after the region list
in the exclusion catalog (see above). If [ConformDS9] **is not** present in the
exclusions catalog file, then the above region file will instruct `TweakReg`
to find all sources in the image that are **not inside** the following regions::

 circle(3170,198,20)
 ellipse(3269,428,30,10,45) # a rotated ellipse
 box(3241.1146,219.78132,20,20,15) # a rotated box
 circle(200,200,50)  # outer circle

Notice that the "true" DS9 exclude region '-circle(200,200,30)' was ignored.
On the other hand, if the [ConformDS9] string is present in the exclusions
catalog file, then the original region file (first example in this section)
will be interpreted as "find all sources in the image that **are inside**
the four regions above but **not inside** the region -circle(200,200,30)".
Effectively we will instruct `TweakReg` to find all the sources *inside* the
following regions::

 circle(3170,198,20)
 ellipse(3269,428,30,10,45) # a rotated ellipse
 box(3241.1146,219.78132,20,20,15) # a rotated box
 annulus(200,200,30,50)  # outer circle(r=50) - inner circle(r=30)


Examples
--------
The tweakreg task can be run from either the TEAL GUI or from the command-line
using PyRAF or Python.
These examples illustrate the various syntax options available.

**Example 1:**  Align a set of calibrated (``_flt.fits``) images
using ``IMAGEFIND``, a built-in source
finding algorithm based on ``DAOPHOT``. Auto-detect the sky sigma value and select sources > 200
sigma.   (Auto-sigma is computed from the first input exposure
as:  ``1.5*imstat(image,nclip=3,fields='stddev')``. )
Set the convolution kernel width to ``~2x`` the value of the PSF FWHM.
Save the residual offsets (``dx``, ``dy``, ``rot``, ``scale``, ``xfit_rms``, ``yfit_rms``) to a text file.

1. Run the task from PyRAF using the TEAL GUI:

    >>> import drizzlepac
    >>> epar tweakreg

2. Run the task from PyRAF using the command line while individually
   specifying source finding parameters for the reference image and
   input images:

    >>> import drizzlepac
    >>> from drizzlepac import tweakreg
    >>> tweakreg.TweakReg('*flt.fits',
    ...       imagefindcfg=dict(threshold=200, fwhmpsf=3.5),
    ...       refimagefindcfg={'threshold' : 400, 'fwhmpsf' : 2.5}
    ...       updatehdr=False, shiftfile=True, outshifts='shift.txt')

   Or, run the same task from the PyRAF command line, but specify all parameters in
   a config file named "myparam.cfg":

    >>> tweakreg.TweakReg('*flt.fits', configobj='myparam.cfg')

   Alternately, edit the imagefind parameters in a TEAL GUI window
   prior to running the task:

    >>> tweakreg.edit_imagefindpars()

3. Help can be accessed via the "Help" pulldown menu in the TEAL GUI.  It can also
   be accessed from the PyRAF command-line and saved to a text file:

    >>> from drizzlepac import tweakreg
    >>> tweakreg.help()

   or

    >>> tweakreg.help(file='help.txt')
    >>> page help.txt
