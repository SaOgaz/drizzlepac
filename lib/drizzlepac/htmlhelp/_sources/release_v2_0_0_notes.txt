DrizzlePac v2.0.0 Release Notes
**************************************
This version encompasses a large number of updates and revisions to the DrizzlePac code, including several parameter name changes and additions.  The scope of these changes indicates the level of effort that went into improving the DrizzlePac code to make it easier and more productive for users. 

Summary of Revisions
=====================
The most significant updates to the DrizzlePac code include:
  - Implementing sky matching, a new algorithm for matching the sky across a set of images being combined by astrodrizzle 
  - Updating tweakreg to now align full mosaics where some images may not overlap others in the mosaic
  - Added the option to write out single drizzle step images as compressed images (to save disk space for large mosaics, and I/O time for single drizzle step)
  - Improved tweakreg residual plots visually while allowing them to be written out automatically when tweakreg gets run in non-interactive mode
  - Renamed parameters in tweakreg and imagefind to eliminate name clashes
  - Added option to select sources based on sharpness/roundness when tweakreg searches for sources
  - Added support for exclusion and inclusion regions arbitrary shape/size when tweakreg searches for sources
  - Added a full set of source detection parameters for reference image to support multi-instrument alignment in tweakreg
  - Added support for new (simpler, more robust) ACS calibration of time-dependent distortion
  - A full 6-parameter general linear fit can now be performed using tweakreg, in addition to shift and rscale
  - Cleaned up logic for sky-subtraction: user can now turn off sky-subtraction with skysub=no, and still specify a user-defined sky value as the skyuser keyword.  This will reduce(eliminate?) the need to manually set MDRIZSKY=0. 
  
In addition to these major updates/changes, numerous smaller bugs were fixed and other revisions were implemented which affected a small portion of the use cases, such as:
  - headerlet code now accepts lists of files to be updated
  - source sky positions (RA and Dec) now included in match file
  - DQ flags can now be taken into account when performing source finding in tweakreg
  - all intermediate files generated by astrodrizzle will now be removed when using 'clean'='yes'
  - a problem was fixed that caused createMedian to crash where there were no good pixels in one of the images (when they did not overlap)
  - interpretation of shiftfile now improved to handle arbitrarily-long filenames, rather than being limited to 24 character filenames
  - documentation has been updated, sometimes with a lot more extensive descriptions

This version of DrizzlePac also requires use of the latest release version of astropy primarily for WCS and FITS I/O support.
